# Setup Instructions for Alchira Blog

Follow these steps to get your blog up and running.

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new project
3. Wait for the project to finish setting up

## 3. Run Database Schema

1. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
2. Open the `supabase.sql` file from this project
3. Copy all the SQL code
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor
5. Click "Run" to execute

This will create:
- All necessary tables (profiles, posts, categories, tags, comments, contact_messages)
- Indexes for better performance
- Row Level Security policies
- Helper functions and triggers

## 4. Create Storage Buckets

### For Avatars:
1. Go to Storage in Supabase dashboard

5. Click "Create"

### For Post Images:
1. Click "Create bucket" again
2. Name it `post-images`
3. Make it **public**
4. Click "Create"

### Set Storage Policies:
After creating buckets, you may need to set storage policies. Run this in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Allow public read access to avatars
CREATE POLICY "Public Access to Avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow authenticated users to upload avatars
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars');

-- Allow public read access to post images
CREATE POLICY "Public Access to Post Images"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'post-images');

-- Allow admins to upload post images
CREATE POLICY "Admins can upload post images"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'post-images' AND
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles
    WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
    AND profiles.role = 'admin'
  )
);
```

## 5. Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
2. Copy the following and replace with your values:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

To find these values:
- Go to your Supabase project
- Click on "Settings" (gear icon)
- Go to "API"
- Copy the "Project URL" and "anon public" key

## 6. Enable Authentication Providers

### Email Authentication (Required):
1. Go to Authentication > Providers in Supabase

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

3. Click "Register" and create an account

4. After registering, go to Supabase > SQL Editor

5. Run this query to make your account an admin:
   ```sql
   -- Replace 'your-email@example.com' with your actual email
   UPDATE profiles 
   SET role = 'admin' 
   WHERE id = (
     SELECT id FROM auth.users 
     WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com'
   );
   ```
